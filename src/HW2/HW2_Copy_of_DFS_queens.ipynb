        "\n",
        "In this algorithm there are no partial boards, and all the board positions have all the n queens placed on the board, one in each row (e.g. by random placement).   The algorithm then attempts to improve the board quality by moving any one queen to another position in the same row which leads to a minimum number of conflicts. Therefore each board position evaluation requires evaluating potentially n^2 new states that can be transitioned to, and the final transition is to the best possible successor state.\n",
        "\n",
        "First some useful helper functions to count the number of conflicts for the queen in each row, and total number of conflicts in the entire board (which is the sum of the individual row conflicts divided by 2).\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the computation of the conflicts is very inefficient and O(n^2) since each configuration is evaluated from scratch.  A more efficient incremental evaluation with O(1) complexity is possible, and will be implemented in future work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also note that the hill climbing algorithm can lead to a local mininum which is not a valid solution.   We use a heuristic where if there is not improvement after MAX_ITERATIONS_WITHOUT_IMPROVEMENT, then the algorithm restarts from a new random initial configuration.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The implemented algorithm can be speeded up in a few ways: more efficient board evaluation, random moves that don't necessarily pick the best successor state (in order to avoid local minima) etc."
